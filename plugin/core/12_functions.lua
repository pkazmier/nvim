-- Generate keymaps for bracketed navigation tuned for repeated motions. For
-- example, mini.bracketed defines the following mappings to navigate between
-- diagnostics:
--
--   [D : go to first diagnostic
--   ]D : go to last diagnostic
--   [d : go to previous diagnostic
--   ]d : go to next diagnostic
--
-- With this setup, if one wanted to move forward three diagnostics and then
-- back one, it would require the following keypresses: ]d]d]d[d. This is
-- a bit cumbersome for me as a Dvorak user due to placement of [ and ] in
-- the number row.
--
-- We could take advantage af postkey in mini.clue to eliminate the need for
-- repeated keypresses of the the brackets. In that case, the above example
-- would be ]ddd<C-c>[d<C-c>. However, this still requires the user to switch
-- back and forth between the left and right brackets when changing direction.
--
-- To make this more efficient, we can remap the uppercase versions of the
-- suffixes to navigate in the opposite direction. This way, the user can stay
-- on one side of the keyboard when changing direction. The above example
-- would then be ]ddD<C-c>. This is much more efficient for my typing style.
--
-- This function generates the necessary clues and remaps to achieve this.
-- I use it twice in my config to change all of the mini.bracketed mappings
-- as well as goto-hunk mappings from mini.diff.
