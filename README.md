# Neovim Configuration

This is my personal Neovim configuration. It has been built around the
[mini.nvim][1] plugin---an amazing set of 40+ modules carefully crafted to
balance features versus implementation complexity.[^1]

> [!Note]
> This configuration is designed for Neovim **nightly**.

    For those looking to explore this wonderful plugin, I highly recommend
    trying [MiniMax][2], which is a fully working self-contained Neovim
    configuration compatible with the current stable release of Neovim.

## Directory Structure

Key concepts:

- Each plugin has its own configuration file. This makes it easier to
  navigate to a specific plugin's configuration via a file picker. It also
  results in smaller files that are easier to read and maintain.

- Plugins are grouped into three subdirectories: `core/`, `mini/`, and
  `other/`. The `core/` directory holds essential configurations that are
  loaded first. `mini/` is dedicated to 'mini.nvim' plugins, while `other/`
  includes all remaining plugin configurations.

- Plugins are loaded in the order of `core/`, `mini/`, and `other/`. Within
  each of those directories, plugins are loaded in alphanumeric order as well.
  Numeric prefixes are used to ensure correct loading order.

- Most mappings are defined in `plugin/core/13_mappings` so it's easy to see
  what mappings have been used and what's still available. In some cases,
  this is not possible, but for the most part, it works well.

- Plugins are managed natively by the new builtin 'vim.pack' plugin manager,
  which is scheduled for inclusion in Neovim 0.12+. Lazy loading is achieved
  using two helper functions from 'mini.deps' called `now` and `later`. Any
  plugin that is essential for startup is loaded with `now`, while plugins
  that are not essential are loaded with `later`.

Below is an overview of the directory structure:
